Fuel Report and Aircraft Performance:
* Fixed several issues with fuel conversion: Metric units now shown correctly in fuel report and
  merge dialog.
* Fuel flow, amount and estimated range now shown correctly if aircraft performance is based on
  fuel volume instead of weight.
* Estimated range in fuel report now considers reserve as in performance edit dialog. Numbers were
  different before.
* Merging collected values into current performance now set changed state of performance file
  correctly to avoid data loss.

Flight Plan:
* X-Plane FMS flight plans now get correct ICAO ID for destination if available. Destination could
  receive an empty id before which resulted in an invalid FMS flight plan.
* Fixed issue where procedure information was lost when loading flight plan into a database which
  does not contain procedures or after switching databases.
* Fixed crash when loading flight plan with invalid waypoint while being connected to simulator.
* Fixed crash that happens with invalid flight plans when switching databases in connected state.
  The active leg is now reset when switching to avoid crashes.
* Removed wrong warning of airway altitude violations where upper limit is 0.
* User set cruise altitude remains unchanged now after victor or jet calculation when east/west rule
  adjustment is off.
* Cruise altitude is now adjusted to next valid value for east/west rule based on the current value
  entered in the user interface. Was always set to lowest allowed value. Now also lowering or raising
  cruise altitude if not valid for used airways when using jet or victor calculation.
* Fixed issues which cruise altitude correction when using metric units.

Elevation Profile:
* Fixed problem where aircraft trail was not recorded in elevation profile when window was closed
  or program was hidden/minimized.
* Fixed issue where flight plan and elevation profile was built incorrectly if waypoints were not
  valid in plan.

Options:
* Restore defaults in options dialog can now be reverted by pressing cancel.
* Resetting map theme back to OpenStreetMap to avoid wrong selection of disabled OpenMapSurfer theme.
* Other small user interface fixes.

Procedures:
* Fixed display issue for procedure leg names like "XAROL+5". Was using wrong distance value before.
* Fixed issue where navaids were hidden on the map if part of a missed procedure in the flight plan.
* Fixed display problem when deleting transitions from a flight plan resulting in invalid approach.

Apple macOS:
* Now showing correct application name and correct application menus on macOS.
* Fixed wrong color button appearance in options dialog on macOS..

Version 2.4.2.beta

* Fixed crash when reading GRIB winds aloft or WMM (magentic declination) data on Windows if
  user's home path contains special characters like umlauts or accents.
* Fuel flow and amount is now displayed correctly in current performance tab if fuel unit is
  changed to volume in edit dialog. Was too high before.
* Removed merge options for aircraft type and model in performance merge dialog which resulted in
  unwanted changes. Now limited to copy and ignore.
* Added real ICAO code to airport to avoid issues with X-Plane's artificial airport ids. Now finds
  procedures for e.g. "AT4" where ICAO is actually "CAT4". Reload the scenery library to see this fix.
* X-Plane FMS flight plan is now adjusted for real ICAO airport idents when using procedures to
  avoid problems loading plan.
* Fixed display problem when deleting transitions from a flight plan.
* Added IATA and ICAO codes to airport information display.
* Adjusted window texts in night style to better see disabled checkboxes like in weather
  tab in options dialog.
* Solved problem where ILS tooltips and click regions appeared in the wrong places on the map.
* Now ignoring first zero value when interpolating fuel for aircraft performance.

===============================================================================

Version 2.4.1.beta

Program:
* Now using an OpenSSL library version 1.1.1 which does not require Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables.
  No need to install any redistributables at all for Little Navmap on a freshly installed Windows 10.
* Fixed issues with OpenSSL on Linux. The libraries are now included in the archive again.
* Now providing two builds for Linux. One based on Ubuntu 18.04 and one based on Ubuntu 16.04. This allows to use
  Little Navmap on older Linux distributions too.
* Updated to latest Qt 5.12.5 library due to bugfixes.

Flight Plan:
* Fixed issue where flight plans exported for Reality XP had departure wrongly set to destination.
* Fixed small issue where flight plan legs were activated when editing plan with aircraft on ground.
* Showing minimum and maximum altitude for airways in flight plan table now.
* Airway now shown as red text if either direction, minimum or maximum altitude is violated.
* Tooltips on red text in flight plan table now show information for airway restriction
  violations or invalid waypoints.

Route Description:
* Added missing alternate airport parsing functionality to route description dialog.
  - Route description can now read and write more than one alternate airport to and from the string.
  - Added option to drop down menu button to output alternate airports to string.
  - Added option to route description dialog drop down menu button that allows to read trailing airports
    either as alternate airports or simply add the airports as waypoints.
* Better error, warning and information messages now.

Logbook:
* Adding route description string to logbook entries now.
* Cleanup in logbook entry information display.

Aircraft Performance:
* Better error checking before calculating elevation profile to fix crashes with invalid destination or departure.
* Fix for flooding log with warnings about invalid arguments when displaying fuel and weight.
* Potential fix for display of wrong fuel flow values.
* Changed aircraft performance to detect cruise phase if aircraft is above cruise altitude.

Profile Display:
* Keeping aircraft on bottom of elevation profile when climbing and on top of profile if descending.
* Now keeping aircraft in elevation profile more at the left side to avoid manual scrolling.
* Aircraft label could be hidden in elevation profile display.

Map:
* Corrected "View" -> "Reset Display Settings" function and added missing display features to
  reset (weather, airspace sources, user features and more).
* Fixed several issues where airspace buttons were disabled and/or not updated properly after changing source.
* Fixed double drawing of waypoints and navaids which are part of a flight plan.
* Fix for right-click into touch areas on Windows which triggered a wrong scroll event.
* Corrected display priorities from map context menu. Logbook is now prioritized before userpoint
  before airport for all actions.

Weather:
* Moved wind and airport weather source from menu "View" to new menu "Weather" since these functions also
  affect flight planning and not just the map display.
* Wind speed and direction fields are now hidden in flight planning tab if no manual wind is used.
  This allows to shrink the flight planning dock window to a smaller size.
* Added tooltip for flight plan waypoint yellow wind barbs.
* Added 5000 ft wind layer to wind menu and toolbar button.
* Lowered wind drawing threshold for flight plan. Wind barbs are now suppressed for flight plan legs below 4000 ft.

Options:
* Changed defaults in options dialog to more sensible values. This will affect only new users of after selecting
  "Reset all Settings and Restart" in the tools menu.
* Fixed several issues with "Restore Defaults" function in options dialog where values were not reset at all
  or reset to the wrong defaults.
* Fixed issues in options dialog where webserver settings were not used or reverted back to old values.
* Fixed issue where the webserver was always started after exiting options dialog.

User Interface
* Added "Reset all Settings and Restart" function in tools menu which replaces the need to delete the settings
  folder in case of issues. This will create a backup of the "little_navmap.ini" and erase all contents afterwards.
* Stacks of tabbed dock windows are now completely closed if one of the docks in the stack is closed by
  using the shortcut, menu or toolbar. Closed stacks are reopened completely if one of the dock windows
  is reopened or activated.
* Stacked dock windows are now correctly raised on shortcut or other activation. Before the stack of dock
  windows was raised only while the dock window was still hidden.
* Fixed issue where splitter handles (in elevation profile and route description dialog) were too large.
* Style "macintosh" is now usable again on smaller screens for macOS. Tabs took up too much space previously and
  prevented dock windows from shrinking.
  Default style is now "macintosh" again after a new installation on macOS.
* Attempt to fix options dialog which appeared without content in some cases.
* More small fixes for more clarity and consistency in user interface.

Little Xpconnect / X-Plane:
* Fixed issue in macOS build where plugin failed to initialize in X-Plane.

Version 2.4.0.beta

Limitations:
* Translations are not updated yet. The user interface will be a mix of your local language and
  English.
* The online and offline manuals are not updated yet. Neither the English nor the translated
  versions. Help buttons and links are functional but point to empty placeholder pages.

Installation:
* You might have to install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable on a fresh installation of
  Windows 10. Most will have this already installed since it is needed by many programs.
  You can get the Redistributable from the following download links:
  **►  Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2019 Redistributable Package 14.22.27821.0:**
     64 bit: https://www.littlenavmap.org/downloads/Windows%20Redistributable%20Packages/vc_redist.x64_2015-2019.exe)
     32 bit: https://www.littlenavmap.org/downloads/Windows%20Redistributable%20Packages/vc_redist.x86_2015-2019.exe)
  **Install both 32 bit and 64 bit versions if needed.**<br/>
  **You can safely skip the installation if you get an error about a newer version already installed.**
* Reloading the scenery library is recommended.
* Reinstall the _Little Xpconnect_ X-Plane plugin to see bug fixes.

Help:
* Draft manuals can be accessed here: https://www.littlenavmap.org/manuals/littlenavmap/release/2.4/en/
* List of closed issues: https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/milestone/7?closed=1
* Included map legend updated.

User Interface:
* Tabs can now be closed and moved in information display, aircraft progress, flight plan and
  search. #437 and #345
  - A drop down menu in a button at the right top corner and a context menu on the tab bar allow to
    close, open and lock tabs.
  - Tab states and positions are saved between sessions.
  - Tabs are opened and/or raised on demand on info click or menu selection.
  - Reset window layout also resets tab layout and reopens all closed.
* Now raising windows and/or tabs optionally on actions like e.g. "Set Destination". Also after
  loading, importing or creating a new flight plan, aircraft performance file or others.
  This should help to avoid confusion when creating new or modifying documents.
  This behavior can be disabled in "Options" -> "User Interface" -> "Raise related windows ...".
* Moved map theme and projection into separate toolbar. This helps to avoid toolbar overflow on the
  right for the map toolbar.
* Changed default layout to use a bigger window which is also used after "Reset Window Layout".
* Added menu item to save all options and window layout. Menu "Tools" -> "Save Options and State". #420
* Now saving full program state after changing options or style.

  "Fuel Report".
* Changed user interface style to "Fusion" as default on macOS since the cumbersome default style
  needs too much space for tabs.
* Fixed issue where table cells where initially not resized and appeared too large despite
  selecting a small font.
* Added display of SSL version into about dialog for easier problem diagnosis.
* Fixed issues where update notification dialog could not be closed.

Options:

  exists. Dialog "Options" -> "User Interface" -> "Propose new name ...". #433
* Added option to add true heading/course to all values in display in smaller font. This affects
  all information, progress and tooltip displays.
  Can be selected in "Options" -> "Units" -> "Show true course ...".  Useful for flying in areas
  with high or unreliable magnetic declination.
* Added option to ignore radio navaid declination when calculating magnetic flight plan leg course.
  This is helpful if you use mostly GPS for flying and do not care about radials of VOR which might
  have an  outdated calibration. Dialog "Options" -> "Flight Plan" -> "Ignore Declination ...".
* Other fuel units (kg/liter vs. lb/gal) can now be displayed in small font besides selected fuel
  unit. This affects the fuel plan and aircraft progress tabs. See dialog "Options" -> "Units" ->
  "Show other fuel  units too". #401
* Added new coordinate formats for display and reading: Plain latitude/longitude or
  longitude/latitude numbers with sign. Can be selected in "Options" -> "Units" -> "Coordinates". Not
  that this also affects the order  (lat/lon vs. lon/lat) when reading coordinates in dialogs if
  selected.
* Added options to change MORA grid transparency and text size.
  Dialog "Options" -> "Map Display 2". #343
* Added separate size option for airport weather icons.
* Added text display options for flight plan legs. Now one can select distance, and
  true/magnetic/rhumb/great circle indicators. Labels indicating type will be shown and values will
  be merged if equal. "Options" -> "Map Display 2" -> "Flight Plan" in tree. #365

Scenery Database:
* Added recursive import of OpenAir airspaces for user database from folder. #236 and #426

    User can now choose between any combination of simulator, Navigraph, user or online airspaces.
    Menu "View"  -> "Airspace Source".
  - Removed online airspace button and function to copy airspaces from P3D to X-Plane.
  - Removed option to read airspaces from "Documents/Little Navmap" in X-Plane compiler.
  - Made airspace databases independent of navdata switch.
* Added better error message about missing "scenery_packs.ini" for X-Plane.
* Added geomagnetic model calculation for X-Plane compilation based on current year and month. #300
  - Resulting table is written into database when compiling scenery library.
  - Showing error dialog about missing declination data. Falling back to world magnetic model if
    database is empty now.
* Added support for the new "gui_label" 3D attribute in X-Plane 11.35 and higher. This gives a more
  precise detection of 3D airports now which will be consistent with the X-Plane airport selection
  and can be used to hide "Empty Airports". #424 and #410
* Fixed display for transparent aprons in X-Plane.
* Fixed issue where FSX was wrongly selected on initial startup on Linux or macOS.
* Potential fix on macOS folder resolution problems that appear when using case sensitive file
  systems. #392
* Added support for X-Plane 8.33 kHz frequency spacing. #409
* Fixed crash that appears when using fsAerodata cycle 1905r1 or later. #413

  - Zoom to ILS on double click in map or selecting "Map" link in information display.
  - Added offset localizer hint to ILS information if runway heading does not match ILS heading.
  - Displaying ILS source for clarification in information panel. Either "Navigraph" or "Simulator".
* Added preferred runways depending on wind conditions to tooltip, airport information tab and
  as detailed table including runway surface and length to weather tab. #187
* Aircraft progress tab now shows red warning text for icing and insufficient fuel.
* Progress tab now shows orange warnings if fuel and time have to be estimated because of
  invalid aircraft performance or an invalid flight plan. Shows also orange warning text if fuel is
  below reserve at destination (needs valid aircraft performance).
* Now showing orange warning text if no active flight plan leg can be found if aircraft is too far
  from plan.
* Tab "Aircraft" on window "Simulator Aircraft" shows gross weight as red warning text if heavier
  than max weight.
* Now displaying more fuel values and weights in alternative units as small text in information
  window and progress window. See above in "Options". #401
* Added new tab to show nearest map objects around selected airport: One list with airports having
  procedures and one list with radio navaids. #344
* Added highlighting of whole airway strings from information window similar to airspaces. #348
  - Highlighted airways as well as highlighted airspaces have tooltips now.
  - Thickness of highlighted lines (airspace boundaries, airways, etc.) and text size can now now
    adjusted with option settings ("Options" -> "Map Display 2" -> "Range rings, ...").
* Added links to FlightAware, SkyVector, X-Plane Gateway and OpenNav web pages in airport
  information which link to the airport information on the respective pages.
* Fuel and time prediction in aircraft progress tab is now based on aircraft performance (if
  available and valid) and therefore more accurate. Will fall back to an estimate based on current
  speed and fuel consumption if aircraft performance is not valid.
* Added message in weather information tab if all sources are disabled.

Flight Plan:
* Added support for alternate airports to map display, flight plan, printing, web server, drag and
  drop editing, all flight plan move, delete, edit and append functions as well as all relevant context menus.
  Fuel calculation considers farthest alternate in fuel calculation now. #230

  Menu "File" -> "Reset all for a new Flight".
* Added dialog to show or hide columns in flight plan table. See context menu of flight plan table.
  Context menu item "Select visible Columns".
* Added columns for true rhumb and true great circle course to flight plan table.
* Better messages about missing and invalid flight plan. Now adding tooltip to empty flight plan
  table space and header label with hints if plan is empty. Same for procedure search. This should
  help new users.
* Now clearly describing which flight plan legs violate altitude restrictions in tooltip of error
  message. #347
* Added warning if cruise altitude could not be detected when loading X-Plane FMS plan.
* Edit flight plan position now allows to use shortcut "Return" for editing of user defined flight
  plan waypoints.
* Added missing region information (where available) for airports in flight plan table.
* Improved route description parser. Now using VOR if a VOR and NDB with the same name are close by
  (for example "LOWI VIC FAL PRU TEA LIRN").
* Fixed crashes after dropping several flight plans into the main window for loading.

Flight Plan Export:
* Added separate export menu item for X-IvAp since format differs slightly from IvAp. #395
  Fixed more issues with IVAP export. Alternate airports are now pre-filled in online format export.
* Added TFDi Design 717 flight plan export format. #399
* Now omitting final DCT for flight factor aircraft export to "corte.in".
  Should fix loading of flight plans without STAR. #394
* Fixed Maddog X export to use correct file extension "mdr".
* Fixed missing "=" in cruise altitude for BBS Airbus export. #396
* Made loading of X-Plane FMS flight plans more tolerant for wrong "DIRECT" instead of "DRCT"
  which comes from incorrect SimBrief plans.

* Added flight plan table export to HTML page. #4
* Fixed issue when saving flight plans from airports with empty names which could crash Prepar3D.

Weather:
* Added NOAA and X-Plane high altitude winds (Prepar3D does neither provide a documented format nor
  an interface). #283 This shows the NOAA wind aloft forecast which is updated four times a day and
  is used as a source by most weather programs and simulators.
  - Display of wind barbs for selected altitude, flight plan altitude and/or at flight plan
    waypoints. Toolbar button with drop down menu or menu "View" -> "Wind Levels" allow to select
    wind display.
  - Tooltip on map shows wind for several layers when hovering over a wind barb. Setting for
    wind barbs tooltip on "Options" -> "Map Display".
  - Hovering over the elevation profile shows wind at position in the header line of the elevation
    profile.
  - Fuel planning now considers high altitude winds. The manual cruise wind selection is still
    available and can be used to override the downloaded winds.
  - Top of climb and top of descent and now adjusted for head- and tailwind.
  - See menu "View" -> "Wind Levels" and "Wind Source", dialog "Options" -> "Map" -> "Tooltips" and
    "Options" -> "Weather" -> "Files and web addresses for wind reports".
  - Download and processing can be disabled in menu if not needed.
* Added display of gusts as red lines in wind barbs for airport weather.
* Fixed several METAR parsing issues related to no data like "///". #441
* Now ignoring ASX weather files written for X-Plane and fixed excessive logging about missing
  file. #422
* Full NOAA METAR file is now downloaded to avoid time consuming single web requests for airports.
  Weather display is now faster on map for NOAA METARs.  Changed NOAA download URL in dialog
  "Options". #359
* Added option to change X-Plane "METAR.rwx" path to allow custom file, e.g. for remote setups
  across a share.
* Added error dialog if weather downloads fail.

Online Networks:
* Added two options to fetch online center boundary from user airspaces. Now optionally looking
  up geometry for online centers either by airspace name or filename. Falling back to circle shape
  if not present. See dialog "Options" -> "Map Display Online" -> "Online Center Boundary Lookup ...".
* Disabled wrong rounding of frequencies for online centers. Now displaying as given.
* Replacing "A7" in online ATIS text now with line breaks.
* Changed AI and online network aircraft icon colors for better visibility. This is also reflected
  in the toolbar buttons. The aircraft icons can still be overloaded by the user.
* Enabled PilotEdge network. #388
* Fixed issue with negative heading display for online aircraft.

Map:
* Added option to display holding on map similar to traffic pattern. Holding can be customized
  before adding to map. See map, search and flight plan context menu item
  "Add Holding at position". #326
* Added menu items and drop down button to hide or show user features like range rings, holdings,
  measurement lines and traffic patterns.
  - See menu "View" -> "User Features".
  - Context menu items for range rings, measurement lines, holds and patterns are now disabled with
    a remark in the menu text when respective user feature is hidden on the map. You have to enable
    the respective user feature before you can add one on the map.
  - Special shortcut clicks on the map like e.g. "Shift+Left Mouse button" for range rings enable
    display of the respective user features silently if hidden.
* Traffic patterns and holdings have tooltips now.

  allows to wait for online map updates to avoid blurry maps. #377 and #384

Map Navigation:
* Added "Click to center map" navigation mode where mouse wheel zooms to center position. Also added
  new "Map Areas" navigation mode using click/touch zones on the map screen. The latter mode is
  helpful for touchscreen navigation. Both navigation options can be selected on new tab

===============================================================================

Version 2.2.1.beta

Aircraft Performance:
* Now always showing both volume and weight in aircraft performance report on tab "Aircraft".
  **Avgas is the default fuel type. Change you present performance configurations to the correct fuel type to ensure
    proper weight volume conversion.**
* Aircraft performance edit dialog now has a fuel type (Avgas and Jetfuel) setting and converts fuel between
  weight and volume in input boxes when changing.
* Flight plan table now shows both fuel weight and volume in separate columns.
* Performance collection now always uses weight and detects fuel type automatically from simulator.
  You can change from weight to volume in the edit dialog which will also do the conversion for you.
* Now showing red error messages on top of fuel report indicating invalid or missing values.
* Small text changes for performance report to make more clear that it is not updated during flight and
  used for fuel planning only.

Online Networks:
* Fixed regression when reading whazzup files. This resulted in occasional crashes and wrong aircraft headings.
* Limited excessive logging when reading whazzup files for online networks and added debug option for error
  reports when reading whazzup.
* Now omitting invalid QNH values from online center or client.

Simulator Aircraft and Flight Plan:
* Flight plan active leg sequencing is now suppressed if aircraft distance to nearest route leg is more than 50 NM.
* Centering of active flight plan leg and aircraft (if enabled in options) falls back to simple aircraft centering
  if distance to flight plan is larger than 50 NM.
  This helps to avoid situations where the program zoomed too far out.
* Changed jump-back-to-aircraft logic to avoid weird behavior (zooming far out and others).
  **When aircraft is on ground or "&Center map on aircraft and next flight plan waypoint" is not selected:
    Start looking around on the map by moving first (mouse drag or cursor keys) and not by
    zooming (mouse wheel or plus and minus keys) to avoid aircraft centering for the time given in options.
    Zooming without movement (drag or cursor keys) keeps the zoom distance.**

Elevation Profile:
* Fixed several issues with elevation profile and altitude restrictions as well as TOC and TOD calculation.
* Now forcing all legs after FAF and FACF to minimum altitude to avoid arriving above ILS glideslope or above VASI.
* Added display of "GS" indicator for certain altitude restrictions.
* Fixed issue with circle-to-land approaches having a lower MAP altitude restriction than runway elevation + 50 ft.
  This resulted in a "cannot comply to alt restrictions" message.
* Made zoom sliders in profile less sensitive to mouse wheel by lowering page size.
* Display of "Above Ground Altitude" now follows climb and descent slope instead of using cruise altitude.

Procedures:
* Now adding last leg "Circle to Land" only if approach has no runway assigned.
  This avoids classifiying too many approaches as circle-to-land.
* Adding new leg type "Straight In" for the last segment between MAP and runway now.
* Fixed drawing issues with missed approaches where first leg is of type "Intercept".
  Missed approach now correctly starts at MAP in these cases.
* The Maltese cross is now applied to either FAF or FACF depending on ILS GS intercept altitude.
* Fixed regression where the last leg to runway was omitted for all approaches.
* Omitting altitude restriction now for waypoints on ILS GS.
* Added workaround for 3-letter airport idents in procedures which were not recognized and showed an error in the
  procedure search (red procedure leg).
* Drawing problems with the turn to the first missed leg solved.
* Fixed issue with manual procedure legs before initial fix.

===============================================================================

Version 2.2.0.beta

=== Notes ===
* List of closed issues for milestone 2.2: https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/milestone/6?closed=1
* A reload of the scenery library is recommended.
* Some new features like the MORA grid, display of FAF and others need an AIRAC cycle from Navigraph
  later or equal to cycle 1810 or the included AIRAC cycle.
* X-Plane: Replace the Little Xpconnect plugin with the new included one to see the improvements mentioned below
  at "X-Plane / Little Xpconnect".
* The manual is not updated yet. Therefore, help links do not work.

=== Changes ===
Elevation Profile:
* Added scrolling and zooming ability to elevation profile. Elevation profile now has a context
  menu also including "show on map" and more functions. Added splitter to elevation profile dock
  window which has sliders for zooming vertically and horizontally. These can be hidden by dragging the splitter
  to the right. Zooming can also be done using mouse wheel (Wheel+Shift for vertical zooming). Added keyboard navigation
  using cursor keys and numpad keys for zooming and scrolling. Panning in elevation profile with mouse click and moving
  like in map. Double click zooms to position on map. #34
* Elevation profile now uses same aircraft icon as map. Changed elevation profile to completely
  adhere to map painting settings like line width, text size and symbol size. Profile display now hides flight plan
  if hidden on map. #298
* Adjusted elevation profile to display passed, active and circle-to-land flight plan legs in the
  same colors like the flight plan on the map. Navaid symbols are now on the descending or ascending line. #298
* Added option to display ILS and VASI in elevation profile if an approach is selected. Menu items
  allow to disable these. #299
* Added calculation and display for top of climb to elevation profile display.
* Now showing procedure altitude restrictions in profile display.

  colors can now be customized in "little_navmap_mapstyle.ini". #34
* Jump back to aircraft functionality added in elevation profile. Uses the same settings as the map. #34
* Giving clear error indication if cruise altitude is too high (i.e. TOC and TOC overlap) or if restrictions are
  violated due to too low cruise altitude.
* Fixed display color of profile labels for night mode. Removed all dark profile colors and pens from
  "little_navmap_mapstyle.ini". Using OS and style colors now. #34
* Solved problems where aircraft in elevation profile jumped to wrong leg or moved backwards. Aircraft remains
  at destination now if moving past last route leg.
* Aircraft track is now ignored when determining profile altitude to avoid confusion when remaining tracks
  result in wrong profile maximum altitude.

Aircraft Performance: (see main menu -> "Aircraft" and tab "Aircraft" in dock window "Flight plan")
Note that the new tab in the "Flight plan" dock window is meant for fuel planning and does not
change during flight (except when collecting performance data).

  well as aircraft performance files ("lnmperf"). #291
* Added indication for DME distance to waypoint ident in procedure search and flight plan table for
  leg types "track from fix from distance", "track from fix to dme distance",
  "heading to dme distance termination" and "course to dme distance". This minimizes the confusing
  duplicate display of idents in the flight plan table. #265
